## Comparison of machine learning models for an accurate classification of quality of wine

##### In this repo, I have analysed how three machine learning models (viz. Logistic Regression, SVM and KNN with their default parameters) classify the data better than the other model by considering accuracy score, recall score, specificity and the confusion matrix of each model.

##### I have also given a conclusion based on the analysis that which model suits the best for classifying the wine data as good quality or bad quality.
