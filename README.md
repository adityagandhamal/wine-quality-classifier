## Comparison of machine learning models for an accurate classification of quality of wine

#### In this repo, I have analysed how each model of the three machine learning models (viz. Logistic Regression, SVM and KNN with their default parameters) perform at classifying the data better than the other by considering the accuracy score, recall score, specificity and the confusion matrix of each model.

#### I have also given a conclusion based on the analysis that which model suits the best for classifying the wine data as good quality or bad quality. 

#### The data used is stored in a .csv file (wine.csv)
